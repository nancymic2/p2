	 	    <p>This is Radcliffe Camera in Oxford. It is the main building housing the collections of the Bodleian Library, though
	 	    	I am not completely sure today. 
	 	    </div>
	 	    <div class="third bord"><p>The building was designed by James Gibbs, and is one of few of that period, it seems, that was
	 	    not designed by Christopher Wren.</p>

	 	    </div>
	 	    <div class="third"><p>I don't know what to say about Oxford. There is nothing like it, except for Rome. I keep going back.</p>

	 	    <div  class="third"><p>This the Sheldonian Theatre. Graduations are held here. This building was designed by Sir Christopher Wren. Like the Radcliffe Camera, it is an iconic sight in Oxford.</p>
	 	    </div>
	 	    <div class="third bord"><p>Check out the men with the bowler hats just peeking out above the wall. Apparently these are not all the original heads. At least I think I've heard that is the case.</p>

	 	    </div>
	 	    <div class="third"><p>To the right of the Sheldonian Theatre is the Museum of the History of Science. Very cool museum. It was the original site of the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford. It also was designed by Christopher Wren.</p>

	 	    </div>
	 	    <div class="third bord"><p>There are 38 colleges of Oxford University. Balliol is one of the more prminent ones along with Christ Church and Brasenose.</p>

	 	    </div>
	 	  <div class="third"><p>The college system is different there. I can't remember exactly but in some circumstances you decide which hall to join.</p>

	 	    <div  class="third"><p>This is the London Eye. It was built originally for the millennial celebration. I've been there a few times but still have not had the time to go up, but the views over the Thames must be great.</p>
	 	    </div>
	 	    <div class="third bord"><p>Next to or near the Eye is the millennium bridge, which is a pedestrian bridge also built for the millennial celebration.</p>

	 	    </div>
	 	  <div class="third"><p>One end of the bridge is near the Globe theatre, which still has a thatched roof, even though it is a replica of the original and was built in the 1990's.</p>

	 	    <div class="third bord"><p>On Oxford Street is Selfridge's, made famous here in the PBS series called Mr. Selfridge. Last year when we were there there was a gold Paddington Bear in the window.</p>

	 	  <div class="third"><p>Oxford Street has lots of shopping as well, including lots of well-known stores, but not Harrods.</p>
