	 	    		We all came out to Montreux
On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around


</p>
	 	    </div>
	 	    <div class="third bord"><p>But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground. They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
</p>
	 	    </div>
	 	    <div class="third">
	 	    	<p>When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race.</p>

	 	    <p>We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty, cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights, a few old beds
</p>
	 	    </div>
	 	    <div class="third bord"><p>We made a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know, I know we'll never forget. Smoke on the water, a fire in the sky
Smoke on the water...</p>

	 	  	<div class="third"><p>As you might guess, this very old song by Deep Purple is about Montreux on Laake Geneva. Montreux is also
home to a number of music festivals.<br>This is the Grand Hotel, and the Casino above is the rebuilt casino. It's all true.</p></div>
