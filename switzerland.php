	 	    	<p>This is Geneva. Where the Rhone meets Lake Geneva. In the background you can see L'Eau, the huge fountain
	 	    		that looks like Ol' Faithful. Geneva is expensive. I believe when I was there a typical base wage was $25 and there were 
	 	    		protests not to institue a minumum wage. A Macdonalds burger is about $20.</p>

	 	    <div class="third bord"><p>
	 	    Geneva is kind of a boring city, I think. It has its advantages though. It is close to a lot of cool destinations all around 
	 	    the lake, such as Lausanne, Vevey, and others.</p>

	 	    </div>
	 	  	<div class="third"><p>Lake Geneva is split down the middle between France and Switzerland. Geneva has great transportation and the
	 	  	airport is about 15 minutes on very nice trains from the city center. Very nice feature. However</p>

	 	    	<p>This is Montreux, as are two photos below. They refer to it as the Swiss Riviera, and with good reason as you can see. Sans
	 	    		the ocean beaches.</p>

	 	    <div class="third bord"><p>Those are the Apls. I am in love with the Alps. From my hotel in Geneva, and everywhere, you
	 	    	can see Mont Blanc.</p>

	 	    <div class="third"><p>
	 	    	Montreux is maybe 40 minutes to an hour outside Geneva by local train. It is one of the more beautiful towns in the area, but
	 	    	there are many. Up the sides of the hills are vineyards everywhere. Swiss wine. A surprise.</p>

	 	    		We all came out to Montreux
On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around


</p>
	 	    </div>
	 	    <div class="third bord"><p>But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground. They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
</p>
	 	    </div>
	 	    <div class="third">
	 	    	<p>When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race.</p>

	 	    <p>We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty, cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights, a few old beds
</p>
	 	    </div>
	 	    <div class="third bord"><p>We made a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know, I know we'll never forget. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUwEIt9ez7M">Smoke on the water, a fire in the sky
Smoke on the water...</a></p>

	 	  	<div class="third"><p>As you might guess, this very old song by Deep Purple is about Montreux on Lake Geneva. Montreux is also
home to a number of music festivals.<br>This is the Grand Hotel, and the Casino above is the rebuilt casino. It's all true.</p></div>

	 	    	<p>This is the UN in Geneva at Palais Des Nations. As you can see it is closed. Perhaps memebership dues were too high.
	 	    		Just kidding, it's after hours.</p>
	 	    </div>
	 	    <div class="third bord"><p>In front, across the street is a very large flat piazza fountain. I guess you could call
	 	    it that. There is a sort of similar one in Government Center in Boston if you've seen that.</p>

	 	  	<div class="third"><p>You can also hop a tram from here or anywhere really in Geneva and go out to Cern. Seems like a 
	 	  	really appropriate class trip for us. Thanks Tim Berners Lee!</p>
