 	    	<br>The forehand is probably the most ubiquitous stroke. You use it a lot. So it's important to work on your forehand.<br>
 	    	Many beginners hit their forehand hard and flat, with the face of the racquet pointing slightly upwards to clear the net. This tends to send the ball off the court and 
 	    		often over the fence. So one technique it is worth practicing is topspin. By hitting the ball with an under-over-around motion, you can send the ball forward and also spinning forward.<br><br>
 	    		In the picture you see here, Federer has just finished his stroke after starting out slightly under the ball, but as he makes contact he will brush over the surface of the ball while also sending it forward. If you practice topspin, you will find your forehand returns stay in more often and also hit the ground and jump fast twoards your opponent, giving you two distinct advantages.
