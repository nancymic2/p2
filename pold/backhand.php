 	    	<br>The backhand is one of the many critical strokes in tennis. There are two basic styles of backhand today, the single-handed and the two-handed. Until the 1970's, nobody used a two-handed backhand, but players like Bjorn Borg began using it for its power.<br>
 	    	<br>Today, Roger Federer is one of the very few professional players employing the single-handed backhand, yet he has won countless championships. When using the single-handed backhand, the stance you see in the photo at left is critical for finishing the stroke. It enhanced balance and reach, and delivers power to the shot.<br>
 	    	To finish the shot, make sure you:<br>

 	    	<ul>
 	    		<li>Finish above your head</li>
				<li>Spread your arms like an eagle in flight</li>
 	    		<li>Pull the stroke across your body</li>
 	    		<li>Hit topspin when appropriate</li>
 	    	</ul>
