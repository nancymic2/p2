	 	    	townhouses and probably has as many or more than Bath in England.</p>

	 	    <div class="third bord"><p>
	 	    	While trying to remember the street this was on, I used Google image search (reverse search) and nobody has posted
	 	    	a photo of this, which is shocking.</p>

	 	    </div>
	 	    <div class="third"><p>Apparently everyone photographs the castle, and perhaps pictures of Fringe, be Edinburgh is a 
	 	    	treasure trove of Georgian houses!

	 	    	retired yacht is open
	 	    	to the public. I suppose steering becomes an issue after a certain age.</p></div>
	 	    <div class="third bord"><p>Leith is on the Firth of Forth, which empties into the North Sea. The firth was as smooth
	 	    	as glass that day. So serene!</p>

	 	    <div class="third"><p>In the background are some new housing towers. As I looked over the magically named Firth of Forth,

	 	    	There is a medium-sized retail mall there with some decent restaurants and the tours of the ship.</p></div>

	 	  	their Christmas menus long before December every year, and it seems nearly evey restaurant does it.</div>
