+ Project 2 is a passphrase generator that provides the user with words chosen randomly from a list of words. The number of words is selected by the user. The user can also choose to add numbers or special characters
+ I will demo my project at the Tuesday night section.
+ All code is mine; design as usual is not beautiful.
+ GitHub URL is https://github.com/nancymic2/p2.git
