	 	    <div  class="third"><p>So, this photo is a little too obvious I guess you'd say, but I'm a pushover for a blue sky, so in it went.</p>
	 	    </div>
	 	    <div class="third bord"><p>Actually, I am awed by most things that are older than I am. But really, the thought of anything surviving 2000 years is just overwhelming, especially for someone who is an architecture fan and a lover especially of classical architecture.</p>

	 	    </div>
	 	  <div class="third"><p>All in all, you have to love Italy. It truly is a feast for the eyes, especially Rome.</p>

	 	    <div  class="third"><p>This is Portovenere. It's a bit of a gateway to the Cinque Terre.</p>
	 	    </div>
	 	    <div class="third bord"><p>This is a beautiful part of Liguria. I could see myself living there. It's really hard to leave.</p>

	 	    </div>
	 	    <div class="third"><p>From Portovenere you can get boats to the towns of the Cinque Terre, which is a fabulous way to go.</p>

 	     <div class="middle">
	 	    <div  class="third"><p>This is Vernazza, one of the Cinque Terre (fiev lands). Because I was not able to fly over it like the owner of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernazza#/media/File:Vernazza,_Cinque_Terre_(panorama).jpg" target="_blank">this photo on wikipedia</a> was likely able to do, my photo is not as amazing.</p>
	 	    </div>
	 	    <div class="third bord"><p>If you check out the wikipedia photo you will see how Vernazza just juts out into the Ligurian Sea. A few years ago it was almost completely destroyed by floods.</p>

	 	    </div>
	 	    <div class="third"><p>This entire area is just incredible. It's hard to get to, but there are trains to each of the villages in the Cinque Terre.</p>

	 	    <div  class="third"><p>This is a shot or various ruins including Hadrian's column, I think.  </p>
	 	    </div>
	 	    <div class="third bord"><p>I might have mentioned that I love classical architecture, and what is more classical than bits of Corinthian columns.</p>

	 	    </div>
	 	  <div class="third"><p>There are lots of excellent views like from Piazza Venezia in the center of Rome.</p>

	 	    <div  class="third"><p>This was taken in Piazza Duomo in Milan. On this particular day there was this woman who seemed to have all the pidgeons under her spell.</p>
	 	    </div>
	 	    <div class="third bord"><p>As cities go, Milan is nice. It has nowhere near the amount of public art that Rome has though.</p>

	 	    </div>
	 	  <div class="third"><p>To the right is the cathedral. I only have time here for a few photos, so the cathedral will have to wait.</p>

	 	    <div  class="third"><p>This is Lake Como. This was a fun week. You can get between the towns by boat all day long and you feel like you can reach out and tough the Aples here.</p>
	 	    </div>
	 	    <div class="third bord"><p>The ferries are a good price, like 20 euros for the day and if you like zipping around on the water, it's a good deal.</p>

	 	    </div>
	 	  <div class="third"><p>The biggest popular town is probably Bellagio. It is at the other end of the lake from Como where the train ends so you can either take a fabulous bus ride over the cliffs, a slow ferry, or a fast ferry. It's an hour basically. It's a long lake.</p>

	 	    <div  class="third"><p>This little temple in Rome, the Temple of Portunus sits next to a similar round one, the <a href="http://www.ancient.eu/article/625/" target="_blank">Temple of Vesta</a>. What's interesting is that they are about 200 years older than the colosseum, yet they don't seem to get much attention.</p>
	 	    </div>
	 	    <div class="third bord"><p>The setting is close to the Tiber, a little past Piazza Venezia. I don't know why people aren't flocking there.</p>

	 	    </div>
	 	  <div class="third"><p>To me this building is perfection. Perfect Ionic columns, perfect portico!</p>
