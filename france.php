				<p>This is Chamonix, with Mont Blanc in the background. Mt Blanc is on the border of France and Italy and also very 
					close to the border of Switzerland...a little like the Texarcana of Western Europe. Not!</p>

	 	    <div class="third bord"><p>The photo does not do the mountain justice. It can be seen from everywhere. It is the highest in the
	 	    Alps and western Europe. It is over 17,000 feet at its summit. </p>

	 	    	<p>This structure needs no introduction. I wasn't going to include it, but I like the photo so here it is. Besides,
	 	    		icons are iconic for a reason, although I usually hate anything touristy, which is a sad statement as these beautiful
	 	    	 structures were not built for tourists. It's not Las Vegas!</p>

	 	    <div class="third bord"><p>Unlike the photo you will see later of Place Bellecour, this IS the Eiffel Tower in
	 	     the background. One day I want to create a collection of European arches. But L'arc De Triomphe is really beautiful.</p>

	 	    </div>
	 	    <div class="third"><p>All in all, it's a nice stroll down the Chaps Elysees towards the Arc De Triomphe. Yes it's similar to 
	 	    	5th Ave in New York, but it's nicer.</p>

	 	     that France is the food capital of the word, well, it follows that Lyon is the food capital of earth. I can confirm.</p>
